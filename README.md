# Palindrome Checker
Welcome to the JavaScript Palindrome Checker, a dynamic web application designed as part of the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification on freeCodeCamp.org. This project serves as a valuable resource for learning and practicing fundamental JavaScript concepts while focusing on algorithms and data structures.

Features:

    User-Friendly Interface:
        The website provides a clean and intuitive interface for users to interact with the palindrome checker.

    Real-Time Validation:
        Users can input any string, and the application dynamically checks whether it is a palindrome in real-time.

    Algorithm Implementation:
        The core functionality is implemented using JavaScript algorithms, showcasing effective ways to determine if a given string reads the same backward as forward, excluding punctuations.
